"Welcome to Earth. I am uncertain what the state of the planet will be when you receive this message, but it was once home to millions of creatures. The most sophisticated creatures are humans, using a complex language to communicate with one another and creating systems aimed to benefit society as a whole. I would love to know what you view as the purpose of your existence. On Earth many people have religions or believe in some greater being who created us for a bigger purpose. "
